- Then run the following commands:

## Question 1

I have provided this in `question1.py`

## Question 2
This is provided in `question2.py`, but I have also reproduced it in `question2.ipynb`.

## Question 3 
This is found in `question3.py`. You can run it from the terminal by 
```sh
python3 question3.py
```

## Question 4
This is found in `question4.py`, I have also reproduced it in `question4.ipynb`.

The **.py** files are what should be looked at for the complete solution, as opposed to the jupyter notebook files.
